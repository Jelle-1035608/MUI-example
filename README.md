# Steps to start using MUI

1. Install MUI: `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`

2. Create a new folder in the `src/app` directory. For now, you can name it `example`. (the name of the folder will be used in the import path)

3. Create a new file in the folder you created in step 2. You must name this file `page.jsx`.

4. Add the following code to the `page.jsx` file:

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    import * as React from "react";
    import { Button, Typography } from "@mui/material";

    export default function Page() {
    return (
        <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", margin: "30px" }}>
        <Typography variant="p">Click it:</Typography>
        <Button variant="contained" sx={{ marginLeft: "20px" }} onClick={() => alert("Yeah you did it!")}>
            Just do it!
        </Button>
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```

5. Run the following command in the terminal: `npm run dev`.

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/example`.

7. You should see a button with the text "Just do it!". Click it and you should see an alert with the text "Yeah you did it!".

8. You can now start building your app using MUI components.

Congratulations! You have successfully started using MUI in your app. ðŸŽ‰
